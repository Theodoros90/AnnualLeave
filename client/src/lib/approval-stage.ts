 * which buttons to offer, so a page never shows one the API is certain to refuse.
 * Keep the two in step, the same way `attachment-policy.ts` is kept in step with
 * `AttachmentPolicyRule`. A mirror may under-refuse (a type not yet loaded reads
 * as manager-only); it must never over-refuse.
 *
 * Manager first, then HR, and each stage belongs to its own role. A Manager cannot
 * decide a request that is with HR at all. An HR Administrator cannot decide a
 * Pending request on a type that asks for the manager — that stage is the
 * manager's, and HR's pages leave such rows out (`isWithManager`) until the manager
 * has decided. What HR holds over an approved request is cancelling it before it
 * starts (`canCancelApproved`, mirroring `CancellationRule.cs`).
