/// <see cref="AnnualLeaveStatus.Approved"/>; this decides whether that means the
/// HR stage or the end. <c>client/src/lib/approval-stage.ts</c> mirrors it so no
/// page offers a button the API is certain to refuse — keep the two in step, the

/// <para>
/// Manager first, then HR, and each stage belongs to its own role. A Manager
/// cannot decide a request that is with HR — approve, reject or cancel — because
/// they already had their say at stage one. An HR Administrator cannot decide a
/// Pending request on a type that asks for the manager — the manager has not had
/// theirs yet — so HR sees such a request once it is approved (to cancel it before
/// it starts, <see cref="CancellationRule"/>) or once the manager has passed it to
/// them. HR does decide a Pending row on a type with no manager stage, which can
/// only be a legacy row or one whose type was reconfigured after filing: nobody
/// else could. A request whose managers are all away, or whose department has
/// none, is filed straight into the HR stage (<see cref="ManagerAvailability"/>)
/// rather than left Pending for nobody.
/// </para>
///
/// A <c>null</c> leave type (a row whose type has since been deleted) is treated as
